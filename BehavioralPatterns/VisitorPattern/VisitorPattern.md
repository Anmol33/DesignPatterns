# Visitor Pattern

## Real-Life Analogy

Imagine a museum where different types of visitors (students, art critics, tourists) visit various exhibits (paintings, sculptures, artifacts). Each visitor has a different way of appreciating the exhibits:

- **Students** might take notes and ask questions.
- **Art critics** might analyze the technique and composition.
- **Tourists** might simply take pictures and enjoy the beauty.

The museum doesnâ€™t change for each type of visitor, but the behavior towards each exhibit changes based on who the visitor is. This is similar to how the Visitor Pattern works.

In this pattern:
- The **museum** represents a structure (objects).
- The **exhibits** are the elements being visited (classes).
- The **different types of visitors** are different visitor classes (algorithms) that operate on the elements but are defined externally to them.

## UML Diagram

Here is a breakdown of the UML diagram for the Visitor Pattern:

1. **Visitor**: Declares a `visit` method for each type of element in the structure.
2. **ConcreteVisitor**: Implements the operations defined by the `Visitor` interface for specific elements.
3. **Element**: Declares an `accept` method that takes a `Visitor` as an argument.
4. **ConcreteElement**: Implements the `accept` method, usually passing itself (`this`) to the visitor's `visit` method.
5. **ObjectStructure**: Holds a collection of `Elements` and allows the visitor to visit each element.
